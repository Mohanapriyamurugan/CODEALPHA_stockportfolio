# CODEALPHA_stockportfolio
This Python program manages a simple stock portfolio. It allows users to add stock details like name, quantity, and price, then calculates the total value. The portfolio can be displayed, saved to a text file, or loaded from it. A menu-driven loop helps the user perform these operations repeatedly until they choose to exit.
